## üìã Pre-Rollout Checklist

### Step 1: Clear Testing Data
Run this script in your Supabase SQL Editor to remove all test data:

```sql
-- CLEAR ALL TESTING DATA FOR PRODUCTION ROLLOUT
DELETE FROM daily_entry_items;
DELETE FROM daily_entries;
DELETE FROM users WHERE email != 'brucen@cxnpl.com';  -- Keep your admin account
```

### Step 2: Enable Soft Delete (Recommended)
Run this script to enable data-preserving user deletion:

```sql
-- Enable soft delete functionality
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_is_active ON users(is_active);
UPDATE users SET is_active = true WHERE is_active IS NULL;
```

### Step 3: Configure Production Environment
If deploying to Vercel, add these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anon key
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Admin password (e.g., `admin123`)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE` - `Australia/Sydney`
